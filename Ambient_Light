/*
  This example code will walk you through how to read ambient light values.
  Chances are good that you'll use this sensor in various environments so it'll
  also walk you through setting the gain and integration time that allow for
  different ranges of lux values. For example using the default gain of 100ms
  gives you a maximum reading of 30,199 Lux. This is great for daylight
  readings but not DIRECT sun. Higher integration times mean higher
  resoultions but lower lux values and vice versa: the lowest integration time
  and lowest gain should be used for mid day direct light. Check our hookup
  guide for more information.
